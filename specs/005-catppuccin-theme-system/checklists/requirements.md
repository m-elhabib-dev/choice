# Specification Quality Checklist: Catppuccin Theme System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-08-25
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All checklist items passed on first validation pass. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were needed — the source description was thorough enough that reasonable defaults covered every open point (see spec's Assumptions section for the defaults chosen, e.g. no system-following mode, standard WCAG-AA-equivalent contrast targets).
- 2026-08-25 `/speckit-clarify` session: 2 additional ambiguities resolved and integrated (see spec's Clarifications section) — theme preview uses color swatches (FR-002), and a brief cold-start flash of the default theme is acceptable. Re-validated against the updated spec; all items still pass, no regressions.
- Ready for `/speckit-plan`.
